### Setting up SSL for Local Development

   ```

   **On macOS**:

   ```
   # Install using Homebrew
   brew install mkcert

   ```
   # Install mkcert appropriate for your distribution
   # Example for Ubuntu/Debian:
   apt install libnss3-tools
   # Then install the binary manually or via package manager
   ```

2. Generate certificates for localhost:

   ```
   mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
   mkcert -install
   ```

3. Place the generated certificate files (`localhost+2.pem` and `localhost+2-key.pem`) in the `public` directory
